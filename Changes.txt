List of Changes:

GENERAL:
- postbackground div no longer hides overflow, all elements are bound properly to their posts so this was not needed.
- (And it cut off the right side of the post boxes which has been annoying me forever) http://i.imgur.com/MeEiJq3.png
- The comma after the last tag on a post is no longer rendered because why not

VIDEO:
- Vine posts now render correctly
- All video post types now resize with their div

PHOTOSET:
- Photosets are rendered using a plugin for formatting/resizing
- Photosets have a custom lightbox plugin for when you click them - Necessary because the Photoset plugin breaks the default Tumblr lightbox

SINGLE PHOTO:
- Single Images now resize to fit their div

AUDIO:
- Soundcloud Posts now show up
- Soundcloud Posts resize with the div
